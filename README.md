On this page you can find some of the extensions. Take a look at the docs to see all of them.

## Getting started ðŸŽ‰

Add the following to you `pubspec.yaml` and replace `[version]` with the latest version:

```dart
dev_dependencies:
  testx: ^[version]
```

After you import the library, you can use the extensions.

```dart
import 'package:testx/testx.dart';

test('some test', () {
  'i am a sample'.shouldBeLowerCase(); // ok
  'hello'.shouldHaveLength(10); // error
});
```
